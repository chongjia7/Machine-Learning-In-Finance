# Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning In Finance



To satisfy one's curiosity, this [link] (https://arxiv.org/search/q-fin?searchtype=author&query=Halperin%2C+I) contains repository of supplements to the assignments provided by 
Machine Learning and Reinforcements Learning in Finance. The five useful papers are listed as below:

- Quantum Equilibrium-Disequilibrium": Asset Price Dynamics, Symmetry Breaking, and Defaults as Dissipative Instantons
- Market Self-Learning of Signals, Impact and Optimal Trading: Invisible Hand Inference with Free Energy
- The QLBS Q-Learner Goes NuQLear: Fitted Q Iteration, Inverse RL, and Option Portfolios
- Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Marketing
- QLBS: Q-Learner in the Black-Scholes(-Merton) Worlds

Commentary:
I find supplements are pretty good for options trading.Another interesting point from the course is the modelling of Limit-Order-Book using the physics-based approach. If you're interested in other applications on cryptocurrencies and so on,
Bayesian Regression is always a good starting point. Here is the link https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf for reference. Of course not to mention the sheer amount of effort required to implement these codes and start making a profitable trade.
