To satisfy one's curiosity, this links contains repository of supplements to the assignments provided by 
Machine Learning and Reinforcements Learning in Finance. 

Commentary:
These supplements are only good for optins trading, in particular. 
If you're interested in other applications on cryptocurrencies and so on,
Bayesian Regression is always a good starting point. Of course not to mention the sheer amount of 
effort required to start making a profitable trading "business".
