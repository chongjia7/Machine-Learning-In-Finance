To satisfy one's curiosity, this [link] (https://arxiv.org/search/q-fin?searchtype=author&query=Halperin%2C+I) contains repository of supplements to the assignments provided by 
Machine Learning and Reinforcements Learning in Finance. The five useful papers are listed as below:

- Quantum Equilibrium-Disequilibrium": Asset Price Dynamics, Symmetry Breaking, and Defaults as Dissipative Instantons

Commentary:
These supplements are only good for optins trading, in particular. 
If you're interested in other applications on cryptocurrencies and so on,
Bayesian Regression is always a good starting point. Of course not to mention the sheer amount of 
effort required to start making a profitable trading "business".
